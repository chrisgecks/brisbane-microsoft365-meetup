# Brisbane Microsoft 365 Community

Welcome to the Brisbane Microsoft 365 Community!

A meet-up for the Brisbane Office 365 & EMS community.

The group aims to share Office 365 & EMS knowledge and best practice in an open and supportive environment.

Come along to one of our events to help learn more about the platform and how it can add value to your business.

It's an opportunity to connect with others using the platform in and around Brisbane, including power users, administrators, developers, consultants, and vendors.

The user group is free, and all are welcome.
